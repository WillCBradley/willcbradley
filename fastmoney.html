        <h2 class="idea-subtitle">Fast Money</h2>
        <p class="idea-body">There are billions of people on the planet.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Once you learn to sell, you can convince many of them to give you money.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">But there's a caveat: selling, alone, isn't enough.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Ethical sales requires a high-quality product. When you break your promises, it hurts you in two ways:</p>
        <p class="idea-body">1) Your <a href="./reputation" target="_blank"></a>reputation is weakened.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">2) Before long, people will stop buying, and you'll have to build an entirely new product just to stay afloat.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Technically, if your market is large enough, you could burn through billions of people with a bad offer...</p>
        <p class="idea-body">But then you'd be a fraud. And no amount of money is worth being a fraud.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">In an ideal world, we wouldn't need to sell.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">We'd just build cool stuff, and grow through referrals.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">So I recommend saving these concepts for when you already have a great product (yours or an employers).</p>
        <p class="idea-body">In the beginning, this means you miss out on fast money.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">But often, fast money now = no money later.</p>
