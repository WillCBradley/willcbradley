        <p class="body-copy">We’re creatures of habit.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">Our brains are built for times when we lived in small tribes, with scarce resources, and the constant threat of predators loomed large.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">But times are changing. Fast.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">And as I watch improvements in AI, I’m reminded of an idea I once heard from Jeff Bezos:</p>
        <p class="body-copy"><i>In a world where everything changes, focus on the things that never change.</i></p>
        <p class="body-copy">For Bezos, these were low prices, fast shipping, and exceptional customer service.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">But what about the rest of us?</p>
        <p class="body-copy">Chances are, you aren’t building a trillion-dollar ecommerce empire. And chances are, you still want to live a good life.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">So how can you and I prepare for what’s coming?</p>
        <p class="body-copy">What ideas are durable enough that we can build our lives on them, even as technology uproots our core assumptions about the world?</p>
        <p class="body-copy">As far as I can see - the old ones.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">Think about it like this:</p>
        <p class="body-copy">How will your local <a href="./glory" target="_blank">accountant</a> react when his entire job is automated?</p>
        <p class="body-copy">Well, if his moral hierarchy is structured around being an accountant, I can’t imagine it’d go well.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">But what if it wasn’t? What if our accountant’s aim was to provide for his family, or be a lifelong learner, or to alleviate suffering?</p>
        <p class="body-copy">All of a sudden, things start looking up.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">The more durable our principles, the more change we can withstand.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">And yet, in recent years, we’ve built lightning-speed, hyper-addictive infrastructure to mainline the newest, most flimsy information into our eyeballs 24/7.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">What could possibly go wrong?</p>
