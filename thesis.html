        <p class="idea-body">I’m willing to stake my life on the uniquely human ability to make creative leaps in knowledge (as compared to computers or other species on Earth).</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Having grounded myself with a foundation of first principles thinking and an understanding of human nature (and extrapolated these to encompass marketing, sales, programming, and offer creation), I have enduring faith in my ability to package and sell such knowledge in a free market.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Then, by voluntarily subjugating myself to a single discipline (medicine), I will amass rare and valuable knowledge — even though the jobs in this field will eventually be replaced, the maturation that comes with studying a single field is non-negotiable, so technological advancement is irrelevant to this process.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">To do this, I will focus solely on medical school. If, before I graduate, the MD qualification becomes useless (meaning people/machines without it can fulfill all the functions of a doctor), I will drop out. Otherwise, these assumptions hold.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">After (and only after) this, each incremental unit of learning puts me in a better position to build something new for the world.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">And no matter how many external factors rise up to block my path, nothing can stop me from working audaciously to alleviate suffering, no matter how locally I’m forced to set my sights.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">All else is a distraction.</p>
