        <h2 class="idea-subtitle">The Specialist And The Generalist</h2>
        <p class="idea-body">The generalist is currently between jobs.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">She had an entry-level role in a marketing agency, but didn’t last long. Wasn’t learning enough.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">She’s also been working on the manuscript of a novel for a while, but it’s slow going. She can’t decide which direction to take the story — so many possibilities, but only one can come to fruition.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Don’t let this creative block fool you: the generalist is very, very smart.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">She sees the world more clearly than most of us could ever dream of…</p>
        <p class="idea-body">But nobody will take her seriously. She’s young (for now) and inexperienced, with next to no track record.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Any time she tries to burrow down into a specific discipline, she gets distracted. After all, time is finite — to improve in one area, she has to sacrifice another.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">And for the generalist, this isn’t a trade worth making.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="idea-body">The specialist is the pride of his family.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Nobody around him had ever even graduated high school, and yet here he is: the highest-performing lens technician in the marketing agency’s TV infomercial department.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">He discovered his love of cinematography in high school, and never looked back.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Before long, he fell in love with the physics of light. Narrowing his interests to lenses was only natural.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">The specialist’s managers often tell him he needs to improve his leadership skills, but they don’t understand. If only they worked as hard as him, these ‘high-ranking’ executives might learn a thing or two about the real world.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Besides, he’s got a safe job, and steady pay. His skills might be narrow, but they go deep, and they’ll always be in demand.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">The market for lens technicians is shrinking, sure, but he’s got a good gig. Infomercials aren’t going anywhere, and even if things get tight, his bosses will keep him on payroll as repayment for his loyalty.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Right?</p>
