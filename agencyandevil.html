        <h2 class="idea-subtitle">Agency And Evil</h2>
        <p class="idea-body">If your goals are superficial, your sense of agency is fragile.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">You can be jailed. Or bankrupted. Or made redundant by superintelligent AI.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">As time elapses, technology moves faster, and the predictability of the world decreases exponentially. At any moment, your goal might be torn from your grasp by factors outside your control.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">This leaves us with two contradictory principles:</p>
        <p class="idea-body">1) Long-term goals give meaning to life</p>
        <p class="idea-body">2) The future is too hectic to plan for (especially nowadays)</p>
        <p class="idea-body">How do we rectify these ideas?</p>
        <p class="idea-body">After all, the outlook seems pretty bleak.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">But not so fast.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">What if we aren’t looking deep enough?</p>
        <p class="idea-body">What if there were fundamental ideas we could safely orient ourselves toward <i>no matter what?</i></p>
        <p class="idea-body">As far as I can see, the answer has to do with evil.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">History is full of terrible acts of cruelty. And they were performed by people no different than you and I.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">After the tragedies of the 20th century, the world’s greatest thinkers tried desperately to make sense of what’d happened…</p>
        <p class="idea-body">And the most shocking conclusion, in my estimation, came from Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn:</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Large-scale moral failure is impossible <i>without moral failure at the level of the individual.</i></p>
        <p class="idea-body">What does this mean?</p>
        <p class="idea-body">If we’re all capable of cruelty, and large-scale moral error requires individual shirking of responsibility, then we’re all burdened with an impossible task – act in a way that brings the most benefit, to the most people, on the longest time horizon possible.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Which begs the question: what if this impossible task is <i>the only eternal goal?</i></p>
        <p class="idea-body">In today’s world, the details of your future are blurrier than ever. You might not end up rich, or famous, or happy, or any of those things.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">But if Solzhenitsyn is right, you’ll always have the option of turning yourself into a force for <a href="./deadwood">fundamental, timeless good</a>.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">And I challenge you to come up with a better goal than that.</p>
