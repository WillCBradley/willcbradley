        <h2 class="idea-subtitle">Money On The Table</h2>
        <p class="body-copy">We’re naturally selfish.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">Millennia of status games have honed our ability to get while the getting’s good (often at the expense of others).</p>
        <p class="body-copy">Which begs the question: </p>
        <p class="body-copy">Why play positive-sum games? Why not optimise for personal gain right here, right now?</p>
        <p class="body-copy">The answer, I believe, lies in your email inbox.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">Think about it like this – in slow-growing, stagnant environments, the total rewards available remain relatively constant.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">There are only a certain number of spots in the cardiology training program. Only a certain number of partners at the law firm or tenured professors at the university.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">When the number of people increases, the pie has to be divided more ways.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">To increase the size of your slice, you tear other people down. Your performance is tied to a set of metrics, but those metrics don’t have to mean anything in reality.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">The scoreboard is king, but the sport is outdated.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">And so people spend their careers shuffling emails between inboxes, jumping through hoops in the hope of being granted access to the next level of the game.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">But this all changes when we come into contact with reality.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">When people are judged against real, useful, undeniable metrics, they either get better or fall by the wayside.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">Over time, this creates a culture of competence, realism, and net growth.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">And because of this net growth, the pie gets bigger.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">(Corollary: if there is minimal/no net growth, the metrics probably aren’t right.)</p>
        <p class="body-copy">Why is this important? Because when the pie’s getting bigger, I don’t have to steal from you to feed myself. When the pie’s getting bigger, I can think long term.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">And when I can think long term, I’m exposed to the upside of compounding.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">Instead of getting while the getting’s good, I can give without expecting immediate return.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">I can leave money on the table, and plant trees I’ll never sit under.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">When short-term generosity is long-term selfishness, we become unstoppable.</p>
