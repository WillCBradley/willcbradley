        <p>Nobody is infallible.</p>
        <p>The principles we've just covered are reliable (as far as I can tell), but they're vulnerable to human error.</p>
        <p>Here's a list of some such errors (so we can invert them):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chase money and status; underlying assets are irrelevant.</li>
            <li>Rely on others to bend the world to your will.</li>
            <li>Place your needs above the customer's - your desire to make money is more important than solving their problems.</li>
            <li>Study what everyone else is studying. Ignore fundamentals and the cutting edge.</li>
            <li>If you get feedback from reality or markets that hurts your feelings, ignore it. Better yet, assume the world is broken.</li>
            <li>Bet the farm on fleeting trends, and never focus long enough to reap the benefits of compounding.</li>
            <li>Refuse to commit to a path for fear of being trapped. Wait until you're <i>sure</i> before doing anything.</li>
            <li>Break your promises when it's convenient.</li>
            <li>Rely on luck.</li>
            <li>Think in weeks and months, rather than years and decades.</li>
            <li>Try to predict the future with 100% accuracy, then bet everything you have on those predictions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There's only one question left: <a href="./whats-next">what now?</a></p>
