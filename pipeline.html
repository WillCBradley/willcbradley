        <p class="idea-body">The concept of “selling” can be intimidating.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Even at the best of times, turning strangers into customers is hard.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">So it helps to break the process down into steps.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">How many people have you reached? How many meetings have you booked? How many leads have you closed?</p>
        <p class="idea-body">The exact steps will vary between offers, but the process is the same.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">This way, you create a “production line” of customers, sometimes known as a sales pipeline.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Then, it’s just a matter of repeatedly removing the biggest bottlenecks in the pipeline.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">It might be a skill deficiency, a poor-performing ad, a low-converting landing page, or all manner of other problems.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">The tactics will vary over time, but this fundamental process never changes.</p>
