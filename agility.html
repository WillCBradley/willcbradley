    <p class="idea-body">Getting into medical school is hard.</p>
    <p class="idea-body">It requires scoring well in predefined tests, in predictable environments, regardless of the relevance of those tests to the real world.</p>
    <p class="idea-body">The result?</p>
    <p class="idea-body">The typical med student is extremely good at making themselves more risk-averse, focused, and obedient.</p>
    <p class="idea-body">This has obvious advantages in a world where memorisation is crucial…</p>
    <p class="idea-body">But what happens when computers memorise everything for us?</p>
    <p class="idea-body">What happens when technology uproots our assumptions regarding the nature of a good doctor?</p>
    <p class="idea-body">And what happens when these changes occur so quickly that it becomes unethical not to implement the newest tools into medical practice?</p>
