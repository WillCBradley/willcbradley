    <p class="body-copy">In early med school, it felt like the walls were closing in.</p>
    <p class="body-copy">New tech seemed to be destroying the ground from under my feet in real-time.</p>
    <p class="body-copy">I enjoyed the topics we were studying, but didn't think they'd be enough to grant me autonomy.</p>
    <p class="body-copy">I was trapped.</p>
    <p class="body-copy">So I started learning.</p>
    <p class="body-copy">I began studying economics, and philosophy, and physics, and psychology, and business.</p>
    <p class="body-copy">This led me to Charlie Munger, Nassim Taleb, Jeff Bezos, Epictetus, Adam Smith, Naval Ravikant, Richard Feynman, and countless others.</p>
    <p class="body-copy">Slowly, I started to see the world more clearly.</p>
    <p class="body-copy">But I'm nowhere near finished.</p>
    <p class="body-copy">The ongoing goal is to figure out how long-term, positive-sum players can achieve durable autonomy from first principles.</p>
    <p class="body-copy">Here, you'll find a distillation of what I learn.</p>
