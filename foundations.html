        <p>Trainable skills were the currency of the 20th century.</p>
        <p>Before a repetitive task is automated, people can solve the same problem over and over, and get paid in proportion to how hard they are to replace.</p>
        <p>Automation threatens to erode these positions, but despite this, some skills remain fundamental to all others.</p>
        <p>Namely: communication and first-principles decision making.</p>
        <p>The better you know these, the faster you can learn anything else.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, they're very difficult to study in isolation (without getting bogged down in a bunch of pseudo-work).</p>
        <p>But with <a href="./truth">the right heuristics</a>, we can get to the heart of the issue.</p>
