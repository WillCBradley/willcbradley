        <p>I can’t shake the feeling that somebody’s being lied to.</p>
        <p>At medical school, I’m told to memorise huge numbers of patterns, and to network in hopes of being accepted into specialty training. But even today, our AI models have superhuman pattern recognition, and we hear of growing training bottlenecks for doctors.</p>
        <p>It seems like a vast amount of talent is being invested into commoditised assets, which in turn are being invested in a career path that may soon disappear.</p>
        <p>Of course, modern medicine has created huge value for society, and helping patients is a privilege. But eventually, the books need to balance, and who’s to say my generation won’t be written off?</p>
        <p>Many have figured this out. Some switched industries. Others made their millions as admissions tutors or productivity gurus. These are all viable paths, but the core problem remains unsolved: most med students and doctors don’t have a clear path to guide them as the world moves faster and faster.</p>
        <p>So I’m trying to build one.</p>
        <p>By grounding myself in <a href="./principles" target="_blank">principles</a> and building self-directed <a href="./projects" target="_blank">projects</a>, I hope to create my own hedge against commodification and automation. By distilling down the learnings here, I hope to make the process easier for future generations.</p>
        <p>And hopefully, in the end, I can increase the odds that truly smart people find truly great opportunities.</p>
        <p>If that’s a plan you can get behind, let me know:</p>
