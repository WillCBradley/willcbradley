Focusing on the 20% of topics that give you roughly 80% of the benefit, here’s a pared-down list:

---

### 2. **Essential Data Structures & Algorithms**
- **Key Points:**  
  - Understand lists/arrays and dictionaries for data handling.
  - Grasp basic algorithmic patterns (iteration, recursion) rather than every complex algorithm.
- **Why:**  
  - This “bare-bones” knowledge is enough to efficiently manipulate data for AI tasks.

---

### 4. **Fundamental Machine Learning Concepts**
- **Key Points:**  
  - Grasp the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
  - Learn simple models like linear regression (for predicting continuous values) and logistic regression (for classification).
  - Get an introductory look at neural networks and the idea behind training them using gradient descent.
- **Why:**  
  - This focus provides a practical introduction to how AI systems learn from data.

By concentrating on these core areas, you build a strong foundational understanding of AI without getting bogged down in every detail. Once you're comfortable with these essentials, you'll be well-prepared to explore more advanced topics as needed.




(Plan: algorithms [big-o notation, recursion + iteration, divide and conquer paradigm], then data structures, then fundamental machine learning concepts)













For an 80/20 approach to algorithms (especially with a focus on AI), concentrate on these four essentials:

1. **Complexity Analysis (Big-O Notation):**  
   - Learn how to measure time and space efficiency.  
   - This helps you understand scalability—a critical factor in AI when processing large datasets.

2. **Fundamental Data Structures:**  
   - Focus on arrays/lists and hash tables (dictionaries).  
   - These are the building blocks for handling and manipulating data in most AI libraries.

3. **Recursion and Iteration:**  
   - Understand iterative processes and the basics of recursion.  
   - Many AI algorithms (like those in search or optimization) rely on these approaches.

4. **Divide and Conquer Paradigm:**  
   - Learn how to break complex problems into simpler subproblems.  
   - This mindset is useful for designing efficient solutions and is reflected in techniques like iterative optimization (e.g., gradient descent) used in AI.

Mastering these core topics will give you a strong, workable grasp of algorithmic thinking that's directly applicable to AI without getting bogged down in less critical details.
