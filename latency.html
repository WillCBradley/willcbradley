        <h2 class="idea-subtitle">Latency</h2>
        <p class="idea-body">There’s a constant tension between strategy and execution.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Without the former, you walk off a cliff. Without the latter, you never walk at all.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">But over time, I’ve noticed a constant trend:</p>
        <p class="idea-body">The lower your delay between decision and action, the better.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">And the payoff is nonlinear. The lower the latency, the faster you act, the faster you get feedback, and the faster you iterate. The knowledge compounds.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">For best results, do things with the aim of learning fundamental, transferable ideas.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Then every incremental learning can be applied to every foreseeable situation. If this sounds disgustingly effective, it’s because it is.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Which begs the question: why doesn’t everyone do it?</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Most likely, it’s because execution is uncomfortable.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">You’ll make mistakes, and take wrong turns, and have your flaws shown to you in painful detail by the market.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">But as far as I can see, the alternative is worse.</p>
