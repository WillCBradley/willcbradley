        <p class="idea-body">The world is constantly changing.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">With live newsfeeds and 24/7 internet access, it’s never been harder to keep up.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">But thankfully, there’s a far simpler way to stay on top of things. And by definition, it never stops being useful:</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Most news is perishable.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">While people tend to focus on what’s changing, the real value it to be found in <a href="./durability" target="_blank">things that <i>never</i> change.</a></p>
        <p class="idea-body">Which leads us to the power of first principles thinking.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Instead of solving problems with top-down guesses, you can start with fundamental truths, and build upward.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">This is more difficult than it seems, but if you want to solve complex problems and see solutions that others can’t, it’s non-negotiable.</p>
