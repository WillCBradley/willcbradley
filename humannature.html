        <p class="idea-body">If used correctly, these principles make you unstoppable. If used unethically, they make you a fraud.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">1. Urgency</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Time constraints make people act (think: limited-time discounts).</p>
        <p class="idea-body">2. Scarcity</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Quantity constraints drive action, too (think: only 5 items left in stock).</p>
        <p class="idea-body">3. Status</p>
        <p class="idea-body">People like being seen as better than others (think: sports cars, watches etc.).</p>
        <p class="idea-body">4. Loss aversion</p>
        <p class="idea-body">The pain of a loss exceeds the pleasure of an equivalent gain (think: don’t miss out on this 50% off sale).</p>
        <p class="idea-body">5. Social proof</p>
        <p class="idea-body">People like to copy others, especially if those others are credible in their eyes (think: celebrity endorsements).</p>
        <p class="idea-body">6. Reciprocity</p>
        <p class="idea-body">We feel uneasy when we don’t return favours (think: free samples).</p>
        <p class="idea-body">7. Consistency</p>
        <p class="idea-body">We’re inclined to follow through on things we’ve said and done in the past (think: this is why politicians accuse each other of lying).</p>
        <p class="idea-body">8. Liking</p>
        <p class="idea-body">We’re more easily convinced by people we like (think: building rapport on a sales call).</p>
        <p class="idea-body">9. Anchoring</p>
        <p class="idea-body">We judge prices based on other prices we’ve just seen/heard (think: lowball buy offers).</p>
        <p class="idea-body">10. Emotion, Then Logic</p>
        <p class="idea-body">We buy with emotion and justify with logic (think: the salesman lets you sit in the Ferrari, <i>then</i> tells you about the fuel economy).</p>
        <br>
        <p class="idea-body">NOTE: before putting these principles into practice, I recommend reading/re-reading <a href="./fastmoney" target="_blank">this.</a></p>
