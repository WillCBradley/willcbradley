        <p>Understand (and aim for) wealth, as opposed to money or status, and radically accept human nature.</p>
        <p>Then, learn to create unique value for society by combining foundational knowledge (such as that learned through exposure to markets and physics) with specialised, cutting-edge knowledge (learned through following curiosity).</p>
        <p>Abstract out the durable compounding mechanisms at play, and plow as many resources as you can towards them.</p>
        <p>Commit to the best plan you have, and allow each step forward to illuminate the next.</p>
        <p>In the process, provide more value than you consume, and always keep your promises (thus building a solid reputation).</p>
        <p>Ignore the "lucky breaks" of others.</p>
        <p>Extend your time horizon as far as you can into the future, and hedge your bets to ensure you aren't taken out of the game.</p>
        <p>And if you do all this, you’ll never have to worry about being replaced (for as long as replacement is a worthwhile worry).</p>
        <p>There’s only one question left: <a href="./whats-next">where could we go wrong?</a></p>
