        <p class="idea-body">First, radically accept human nature.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Then, learn to create value for society by combining foundational knowledge (communication and first-principles thinking) with specialised, cutting-edge knowledge.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Apply this knowledge creatively to solve problems that nobody else in the world could've tackled.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Use these unique solutions to help other people (and hence build a solid reputation).</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Have irrationally high levels of agency, and unreasonably high faith in the process of compound interest.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Ignore the people around you who get “lucky breaks”.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Extend your time horizon as far as you can into the future.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">And if you do all this, you’ll never have to worry about being replaced (for as long as replacement is a worthwhile worry).</p>
        <p class="idea-body">There’s only one question left: <a href="./whatsnext">what’s next?</a></p>
