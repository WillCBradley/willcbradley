    <p class="idea-body">Most of my heroes got rich the same way:</p>
    <p class="idea-body">They focused on single projects for decades, and reaped the rewards of compound interest in the process.</p>
    <p class="idea-body">But the world is speeding up.</p>
    <p class="idea-body">The only constant factors are core <a href="./principles">principles</a>, and these are too general to package and sell to the market on their own.</p>
    <p class="idea-body">The alternative?</p>
    <p class="idea-body">Rely on two other compounding vehicles: relationships and track record.</p>
    <p class="idea-body">I plan on living for many more decades. By spending this time with long-term, positive-sum dealmakers, I hope to contribute to a future that our great grandchildren can feel optimistic about.</p>
    <p class="idea-body">If thatâ€™s a plan you can get behind, <a href="./contact">reach out</a>.</p>
