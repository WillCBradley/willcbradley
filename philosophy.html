    <p class="idea-body">The world is speeding up.</p>
    <p class="idea-body">The next few decades feel completely unpredictable.</p>
    <p class="idea-body">So it seems impossible to reap the benefits of long-term focus on a single project (and the resultant compound interest).</p>
    <p class="idea-body">The alternative?</p>
    <p class="idea-body">Rely on two other compounding vehicles: relationships and track record.</p>
    <p class="idea-body">I plan on living for many more decades. By spending this time with long-term, positive-sum dealmakers, I hope to contribute to a future that our great grandchildren can feel optimistic about.</p>
    <p class="idea-body">If thatâ€™s a plan you can get behind, reach out.</p>
