        <p class="idea-body">Technology makes things easier.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Gone are the days of cesspools, bloodletting, and worldwide starvation.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">No doubt, this is a wonderful achievement. But in the process of making everything easier, we run a terrifying risk.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Without challenge, it’s tempting to revert to self-centred hedonism.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">After all, what meaningful pursuits are possibly at our disposal, given the uncertainty of the future?</p>
        <p class="idea-body">I struggled with this question for a long time. And now, I think I’ve found the missing puzzle piece (or, at least, one of them).</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Technology didn’t just remove difficulty. It weakened our communities.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">As we became less dependent on each other for survival, our institutions started to erode faster than we could rebuild them.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">And so, inevitably, we directed our efforts inward.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Why gain status through productive generosity when you can post memes on Instagram? Why invest in real-world friendships when you can watch Friends on Netflix?</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Before long, our collective time horizon began to shrink.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">We cast our eyes down from the landscape of potential sculpted for us by our forefathers, <a href="./deadwood" target="_blank">in spite of their suffering</a>.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">We let our gaze narrow to our present selves.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Me, regardless of everyone else. Now, regardless of the future.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">But this was a choice. And it’s reversible.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">The future may be too uncertain for shallow, self-serving plans, but we can build something more <a href="./durability" target="_blank">durable</a>.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">We can reject the zero-sum, learned helplessness of past decades, and set our sights on a more optimistic, far-reaching alternative.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">If we each resolve to become worthy ancestors, to <a href="./table" target="_blank">plant trees we’ll never sit under</a>, there’s no storm we can’t endure.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">And, by embedding these ideas at the level of the individual, rather than the institution, we give them the flexibility needed to ride out the technological waves of the future.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">This might be the only safe path forward.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">I guess we’ll see.</p>
