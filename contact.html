    <p>All over the world, smart people are working an training in healthcare jobs that (I believe) may soon plummet in demand. By the time you're reading this, it might already have happened.</p>
    <p>This site is designed to put the best of the best on my radar. The idea is that, whether it's 2 weeks or 20 years from now, we might team up, solve a hard problem, and get paid accordingly.</p>
    <p>If that sounds good, then <a target="_blank" href="mailto:will@willcbradley.com">let me know who you are (and what you've built).</a></p>
