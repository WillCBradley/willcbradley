    <p>Millions of smart people are in healthcare jobs that (I believe) may one day plummet in demand. Maybe, by the time you're reading this, it's already happened.</p>
    <p>This site is designed to put the best of these people on my radar. Hopefully, whether it's 2 weeks or 20 years from now, we might team up, solve hard problems, and get paid accordingly.</p>
    <p>If that sounds good, then <a target="_blank" href="mailto:will@willcbradley.com">let me know who you are (and what you've built).</a></p>
    <p> - Will</p>
