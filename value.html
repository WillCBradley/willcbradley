        <p>People aren’t stupid.</p>
        <p>They’re not going to give us something for nothing (at least, we shouldn’t bank on it).</p>
        <p>So, if we want something valuable from society, we need something valuable to provide in exchange.</p>
        <p>Historically, people have done this by getting jobs, and doctors are no different.</p>
        <p>But when repeatable/algorithmic tasks (e.g. diagnosis, repeated surgery) are automated, employees’ pricing power can be eaten away.</p>
        <p>(After all, when’s the last time you saw a rich lamp-lighter?)</p>
        <p>Instead, we need some way of creating future-proof value, without taking our eye off the ball with today’s patients.</p>
        <p>I thought about this problem for a long time, before settling on a two-pronged approach.</p>
        <p>Let's start with <a href="./foundations">prong one.</a></p>
