        <p class="idea-body">The world is full of problems to be solved.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Each problem (e.g. reading a CXR, interpreting bloods) can have many variables.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">We call any single combination of these variables an "instance" of the problem â€” a single pathology image is an <i>instance</i> of the <i>problem</i> of reading pathology images.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">An algorithm is a generalised procedure that can solve all instances of a given problem.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Heuristics, on the other hand, are rules of thumb that can solve most instances, but aren't always exactly optimal (and, sometimes, can be very wrong).</p>
        <p class="idea-body">We, as humans, often rely on heuristics, using our own judgements to plug the gaps as required. It's easy to see how this could slow automation if all computers required explicit algorithms for every problem.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">But that "if" is looking shakier by the minute.</p>
