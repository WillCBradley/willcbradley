        <p>We can define agency as “the refusal to accept constraints at face value”.</p>
        <p>This lets high-agency people make moves that others deem impossible. And because of this, they get outsized returns on their judgement.</p>
        <p>But there’s one important caveat:</p>
        <p>Things are complex.</p>
        <p>No one person can rewrite all the rules from scratch.</p>
        <p>Which is why we should think of agency as “respectful audacity”.</p>
        <p>Aim for rigorous understanding, not arrogant ignorance.</p>
        <p>And to do that, it’s crucial to never make a bet that could take you out of the game.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, when you poke a system, the system bites back. Learn to appraise downside risk, and you get infinite shots on goal.</p>
        <p>Which leads nicely onto <a href="./abstraction">abstraction.</a></p>
